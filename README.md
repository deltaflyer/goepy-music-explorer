# [Goepy Music Explorer](http://www.goepy.de)

The GoePy Music Explorer is a demo that illustrates the power of two python libraries [spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) and [bottle](http://www.bottlepy.org). The GoePy Music Explorer is a web application that gives you the opportunity to search for music artists and browse through all albom covers. **Spotipy** is used to extract public data from the Spotify web API and **bottle** is used to run the web app and to realize REST functionality.
